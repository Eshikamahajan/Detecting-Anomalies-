# Anomaly Detection
Anomaly detection (aka outlier analysis) is a step in data mining that identifies data points, events, and/or observations that deviate from a datasetâ€™s normal behavior. Anomalous data can indicate critical incidents, such as a technical glitch, or potential opportunities, for instance a change in consumer behavior. Machine learning is progressively being used to automate anomaly detection.


# Using LSTMs AutoEncoders
LSTMs are explicitly designed to avoid the long-term dependency problem. Remembering information for long periods of time is practically their default behavior, not something they struggle to learn!
