# Anomaly Detection
Anomaly detection (aka outlier analysis) is a step in data mining that identifies data points, events, and/or observations that deviate from a datasetâ€™s normal behavior. Anomalous data can indicate critical incidents, such as a technical glitch, or potential opportunities, for instance a change in consumer behavior. Machine learning is progressively being used to automate anomaly detection.


# Using LSTMs AutoEncoders
LSTMs are explicitly designed to avoid the long-term dependency problem. Remembering information for long periods of time is practically their default behavior, not something they struggle to learn!


The below figure depicts the repeating module in an LSTM containing four interacting layers.

# The Dataset
The S&P 500, or simply the S&P, is a stock market index that measures the stock performance of 500 large companies listed on stock exchanges in the United States. It is one of the most commonly followed equity indices, and many consider it to be one of the best representations of the U.S. stock market.
